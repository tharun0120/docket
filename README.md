# Docket.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another feature rich, fast and minimalist Todo App with awesome features like search recommendation, streak based appeaciation and much more to look foreward to.

> Now being organised and nailing those ideas and thoughts into actionable events is easier than ever.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the highlights of Docket. are,

- ⚡ Persistent user authentication using the powerful yet simple redux ([redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) to be precise) with the help of our beloved broweser api local storage

- 🔥 Streak based appreciation system for that juicy adrenaline and that sense of satisfaction

- 🔎 Search function with autocomplete to search for all those backlogged or forgotten tasks (or should I say dockets 😉) powered by mongodb atlas search with the help of indexes

- 🌐 Live version deployed on heroku for that sweet full stack deployement in minimal to no time
