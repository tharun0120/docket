### Overview of My Submission

    Hello There! I am Tharun and I am really happy to present to you the **Docket.** (You guessed it, a ToDo App). It is powered by the beloved [react](url) with [node](url) as the backend doing all the heavy lifting and ofcourse, one of the the well thought out and most awesome nosql database out there our favorite [MongoDB](url) storing all the app's data.

    Some of the highlights of Docket. are,

- Persistent user authentication using the powerful yet simple redux ([redux-toolkit](url) to be precise) with the help of our beloved broweser api local storage

- 🔥 Streak based appreciation system for that juicy adrenaline and that sense of satisfaction

- 🔎 Search function with autocomplete to search for all those backlogged or forgotten tasks (or should I say dockets 😉) powered by mongodb atlas search with the help of indexes

- 🌐 Live version deployed on the student/dev platform heroku for that sweet full stack deployement in minimal to no time
